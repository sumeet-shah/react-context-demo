## Context API

- This is the technique that react provides using which we can maintain application wide states. 
- Way to manage state globally. 
- Redux is what then replaced this technique completely. 
- So if we know redux this is kind of redundant knowledge.  
- ### Create Context
  - Create context global object. 
  - It would need to have initial context object. 
- ### Provider Context
  - Wrapper using this the component trees where we would need to use the context specific data. 
  - While wrapping also we would need to pass the data which consumers can the use. 
  - in a given tree of component, this would be the max parent, from where data propagation then can happen. 
  - Using context data propagation can only happen downwards. 
  - Upwards data propagation still needs to happen through props with method mechanism. 
- ### Consumer Context
  - use this in the component where context data is to be used. 
  - we can use `useContext` hook as well for this purpose which then gives the object of the original State that was provided to the provider object.
- ### Why do we need to go with redux instead of this?
  - Context api is not yet ready handle high frequency updates. That could have some performance bottleneck issues. 
  - For small application storing some not frequently changing state data it is okay to use.
